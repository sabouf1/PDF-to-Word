# PDF to Word Converter in Python

This is a Python script that uses the `pdf2docx` library to convert a PDF file to a Word (DOCX) file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `pdf2docx` library installed. You can install it using the following command:
  ```
  pip install pdf2docx
  ```

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have the required input PDF file (e.g., `input.pdf`) in the same directory as the script.

3. Open the script (`pdf_to_word_converter.py`) in a text editor.

4. Replace the placeholders in the script with the appropriate file paths:
   - Replace `input.pdf` with the path to your input PDF file.
   - Replace `output.docx` with the desired output Word (DOCX) file name.

5. Save the changes.

6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

7. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python pdf_to_word_converter.py
   ```

8. The script will convert the input PDF file to a Word file (DOCX) and save it with the specified output file name.

9. Once the conversion is complete, you will see a message indicating that the output has been saved.

## Important Note
- The `pdf2docx` library relies on the LibreOffice software to perform the conversion. Make sure you have LibreOffice installed on your system for the converter to work correctly.
